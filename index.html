              <p>
                Autumn, season of the year between summer and winter during
                which temperatures gradually decrease. It is often called fall
                in the United States because leaves fall from the trees at that
                time. Autumn is usually defined in the Northern Hemisphere as
                the period between the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in
                length), September 22 or 23, and the winter solstice (year’s
                shortest day), December 21 or 22; and in the Southern Hemisphere
                as the period between March 20 or 21 and June 21 or 22. The
                autumn temperature transition between summer heat and winter
                cold occurs only in middle and high latitudes; in equatorial
                regions, temperatures generally vary little during the year. In
                the polar regions autumn is very short. For physical causes of
                the seasons, see season.

              <p>
                Winter, coldest season of the year, between autumn and spring;
                the name comes from an old Germanic word that means “time of
                water” and refers to the rain and snow of winter in middle and
                high latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere it is commonly
                regarded as extending from the winter solstice (year’s shortest
                day), December 21 or 22, to the vernal equinox (day and night
                equal in length), March 20 or 21, and in the Southern Hemisphere
                from June 21 or 22 to September 22 or 23. The low temperatures
                associated with winter occur only in middle and high latitudes;
                in equatorial regions, temperatures are almost uniformly high
                throughout the year. For physical causes of the seasons, see
                season.

              <h2 class="title">Summer<span>Season</span></h2>
              <p>
                Summer, warmest season of the year, between spring and autumn.
                In the Northern Hemisphere, it is usually defined as the period
                between the summer solstice (year’s longest day), June 21 or 22,
                and the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in length),
                September 22 or 23; and in the Southern Hemisphere, as the
                period between December 22 or 23 and March 20 or 21. The
                temperature contrast between summer and the other seasons exists
                only in middle and high latitudes; temperatures in the
                equatorial regions generally vary little from month to month.

              <p>
                Spring, in climatology, season of the year between winter and
                summer during which temperatures gradually rise. It is generally
                defined in the Northern Hemisphere as extending from the vernal
                equinox (day and night equal in length), March 20 or 21, to the
                summer solstice (year’s longest day), June 21 or 22, and in the
                Southern Hemisphere from September 22 or 23 to December 22 or
                23. The spring temperature transition from winter cold to summer
                heat occurs only in middle and high latitudes; near the Equator,
                temperatures vary little during the year. Spring is very short
                in the polar regions. For physical causes of the seasons, see
                season.
